The UBTECH Sydney Artificial Intelligence Centre is committed to advancing AI to endow machines with the capabilities of perceiving, learning, reasoning and behaviour. Our researchers design shallow or deep models to extract, represent and understand information encoded in data and build algorithms and theories.

We aim to establish, analyse and evaluate models that can: learn and make predictions on data; create prototypes or applications to investigate autonomous agent actions; and identify patterns and apply logic. Ultimately our vision is to lead AI research in Australia and become one of the most prestigious AI research hubs in the world.

AI is a transformative technology that promises tremendous societal and economic benefit. It has the potential to revolutionise how we live, work, learn, discover and communicate. Research into AI can advance Australia's national priorities, including greater economic prosperity, improved educational opportunities and quality of life, and enhanced national and homeland security.
